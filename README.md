# GraphiQL App

GraphiQL App is a powerful GraphQL playground and IDE developed by a collaborative team of three skilled developers. This application offers advanced features such as robust authorization, authentication capabilities, and the flexibility to work with any specified open GraphQL endpoint.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18**: The application leverages the latest version of React to ensure modern and efficient user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for enhanced code quality and maintainability.
- **Firebase**: Utilized for authentication, implementing secure email/password sign-in methods.
- **GraphQL**: The app supports seamless interactions with GraphQL APIs.
- **Context API**: Implemented for efficient state management, including localization features.
- **Vite**: Chosen as the build tool to enhance development speed and efficiency.
- **CSS Frameworks**: Used for styling to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **Testing Library**: Comprehensive testing to ensure robust functionality with a minimum coverage of 80%.
- **Eslint and Prettier**: Enforced coding standards and formatting for clean and consistent code.
- **Husky Git Hooks**: Implemented to run linting on pre-commit and testing on pre-push, ensuring code quality.

## Application Structure

The GraphiQL App is structured with the following key components:

1. **Welcome Page**: Introduces the user to the application, providing general information about the developers, project, and course.
2. **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and sign-up functionality with client-side validation.
3. **GraphiQL Page**: A robust GraphQL editor with features such as query editing, variable and header sections, a lazy-loaded documentation explorer, and a response section.

## Branching Strategy

The team follows a well-defined branching strategy, utilizing branches named 'develop' and 'main' in adherence to industry best practices.

## Repository Information
